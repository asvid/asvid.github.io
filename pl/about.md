I'm Android developer at [Payworks][p], but I used to do web development.
I'm clean code fan interested in software architecture, design patterns and devops culture, I really like automating stuff (I'm lazy in positive sense).

In my spare time, I try not to forget how to play guitar, read books, watch really bad movies, or make my own Android apps - usually as sandboxes to check new libraries or approaches. I also like wasting time on computer games :)

I want to use this space to write about technical problems I've experienced and how I solved (or avoided) them, useful tools and tricks and... well anything else I want to write here.

### Contact me

Find me on [Linekdin][linkedin] / [Github][github] / [Facebook][fb] or just say `Hello` at
