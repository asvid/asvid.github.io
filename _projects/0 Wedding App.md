title: Wedding App (work title)
description: I wanted to play a bit with Flutter and my ex-work mate told me he is doing app for his wedding... so I combined both things :) It's Android/iOS app that uses Firebase for storing and sharing photos, guest book entries and venue info. There is also a Google map with quick jump to navigation to POI related to my wedding. BLoC architecture, CI/CD with Bitrise, custom fonts and colors including map. I had a lot of fun with async methods and connecting it all together with Realtime Database.
