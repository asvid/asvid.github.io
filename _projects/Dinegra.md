title: Dinegra
description: Itâ€™s a car assistant Android app. User can register fuel usage, call help, see POI on Google Map. App tracks drivers routes, that can be used in challenges or events (like Endomondo). OpenGL is used to create animated bot, that can talk with you. App also can be controlled by voice commands. App can also be a silent thief alarm - when armed, it will send you emails where the car is if it moves from parking place without disarming. We also made Websocket voice operated chat for drivers nearby, like CB radio.
