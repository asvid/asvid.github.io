title: Fibaro App
description: Smartphone and tablet app to control intelligent home system. Communication based on Volley and GCM. Itâ€™s an old app, refactored over time, by using MVP pattern and unit tests in in Spock / Groovy. For videocalls we used Linphone Library. We also provided widgets and Android Watch App. Recently, I managed to establish and introduce a strict codestyle and static code analysis with SonarQube. App releases are automated with Fastlane.
