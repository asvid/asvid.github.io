title: Frigo
description: My graduation project. I've used Kotlin as weapon of choice for Android app. It uses Realm for storage and Retrofit for communication. App uses GCM for instant data synchronization and request caching if internet is not available. Backend of app is made in ExpressJS working on Heroku with MongoDB database. During development, I started an open source library for Android notifications called - Notti.
