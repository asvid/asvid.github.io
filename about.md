I'm Android developer at [Fibaro Home Inteligence][f], but I used to do web development too.
I'm clean code fan interested in software architecture, design patterns and dev-ops culture, I really like automating stuff.

In my spare time, I try not to forget how to play guitar, read books (mostly about programming), watch really bad movies, or make my own Android apps - usually as sandboxes to check new libraries or approaches. I also like wasting time on computer games :)

I want to use this space to write about technical problems I've experienced and how I solved (or avoided) them, useful tools and tricks and... well anything else I want to write here.
