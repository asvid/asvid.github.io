Iâ€™m a software engineer with diverse experience, having worked on educational apps, smart home technology, and large- scale financial tech projects. I prioritize writing clean and understandable code and ensuring its stability through robust testing. While applying SOLID, DRY, and other principles, I try to avoid hasty abstractions, to keep things as simple
as possible, for as long as possible, and not over-engineer.

I have lots of experience with legacy code, but I also started some fresh green-field projects, and learned a lot by mistakes I made there.

Furthermore, I enjoy task automatization with CI/CD approach in mind. I used to design and implement release procedures for mobile apps.


In my spare time, I try not to forget how to play guitar :guitar:, read books :books:, watch really bad movies :movie_camera:, or wasting time on computer games :video_game:. I like camping :tent: and hiking :sunrise_over_mountains:.
