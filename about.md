I'm Android developer at [Fibaro Home Inteligence][f], but I used to do web development too.
I'm clean code fan interested in design patterns and dev-ops.

In my spare time, I play with [arduino][ard], or make my own Android apps. I also like wasting time on computer games :) 

I want to use this space to blog about technical problems I experienced and how did I solve (or avoid) them, so others can make use of my work.
