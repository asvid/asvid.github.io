This is first post, so I just want to say HI!

Currently I'm working on my graduation project at [Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology][put], that contains Android app written in Kotlin, and sever app in Python with Django. So if you are interested in how I will make this work, stay tuned :)

Project name is **Frigo** and logo looks like that:

Hopefully it will help you manage your food better.
